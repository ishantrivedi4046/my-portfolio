              My software development journey started when I was in college. I
              started it just to learn something new but immediately drawn in
              and understood it&apos;s full potential. After my first
              successfull deployment of android app on playstore I went all in
              the universe of software development.
              <br />
              <br />
              For the past 3 years, I&apos;ve been working full-time as an
              software developer with clients I could only dream of a while ago.
              I deeply care about honesty and transparency, it&apos;s at the
              center of everything I do. I most enjoy building software in the
              sweet spot where design and engineering meet â€” things that look
              good but are also built well under the hood.
